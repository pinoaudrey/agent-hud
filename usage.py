"""Subscription usage collectors.

- Claude: live usage API (api/oauth/usage) using the OAuth token Claude Code
  stores in the macOS Keychain. Same endpoint the /usage command uses. Those
  access tokens only last ~8 hours and Claude Code renews one lazily, when it
  makes a call of its own, so an account you haven't touched today has a dead
  token on disk. We renew it here from the stored refresh token and write the
  result back, which keeps both tools on one credential.
- Codex: rate_limit snapshots embedded in local rollout files; the newest
  account-wide rate-limit event wins. No API call needed, but data is only as
  fresh as your last Codex turn.
- OpenCode: no subscription quota (BYOK), so we report 7-day API spend from
  its local database instead.
